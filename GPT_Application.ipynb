This aircraft had excellent seat pitch, thanks to slim line seating, a complimentary bottle of water was in the seat pocket on boarding. There was WiFi screening of entertainment via an app, which worked. There are no individual tv screens in the seat backs in this particular aircraft. Food was identical to the offerings you'd expect on BA, AA or UA, basic but ok. All beverages were chargeable, except tea/ coffee with meal. The return from New York was a Thomas Cook aircraft which had individual tv screens in the seat backs. On boarding water bottle, pillow and blanket were placed on seat. Leg room was excellent. On take off and cheese and tomato sandwich, followed by a drinks service were provided. Then crew dimmed the lights for three hours allowing passengers to attempt to sleep. An hour and half prior to landing in Manchester a hot breakfast of scrambled eggs etc was served. On both flights departed and arrived on time and had crew who were friendly and professional. The ticket was Â£400/500 cheaper than the other airlines (VS & UA) who fly the MAN NYC route. Would I recommend? Yes. Have already rebooked for June next year, but in premium economy.   \n",

We asked for a supervisor who still refused to do anything. Finally agree but had delayed us so long we missed our flight. To add insult to injury they stuck us in economy on the next flight. Interesting to see they do not honor United premier or upgrades. Pretty unhappy with desk service!   \n",

I took a flight from Toronto to Xiâ€™an on January 24. In fact, I am a Gold Card member of China Eastern Airline, I have not taken a lot with Hainan Air in recent years. However, when I am boarding this time, every flight attendant I met with practical action proves that Hainan Airlines offers the best service in mainland China. I appreciate the two flight attendants in the front cabin. My mobile phone accidentally dropped while I was sleeping, a flight attendant in the front cabin calmed my emotions and called his colleague to help me find it together. I have now returned to China, and I believe that Hainan Airlines will be my priority when I travel next time.   \n",

Our flight took off delayed of one hour from Cancun, when we finally arrived in MIA we had only about 1 hour to the connection. So then the 1st soap opera began, no one came to take my stepfather (the handicap) at the plane, after 10 min some one came and left him at a place with others, then the lady from AA said we should reschedule our flight home for the other day, after a brief discussion she called someone and he and my mother went one way and my sister, niece and brother in law in another. We used the APC (Automated Passport Control) and went to the line, or should i say lines, i went one way. then security control. We all met after SC and went to the gate, there the second soap opera began. apparently some battery had to be changed and after multiple delays, emails, and texts and about 3 hours waiting later they decided to change the airplane, so we had to change gates too. more one hour waiting. So boarding began and after everyone were cozy (as much as you can be on a old AA aircraft) all kinds of excuses began. 1st was that we were waiting the green light from Dallas 2nd the hours of the pilots were over so they had to call other, then it was the time of the crew (they cancelled a flight to Rio so they came to our plane) all that took us about 4 hours inside the aircraft and all they offered us was a glass of water. i can say with certainty that i will never set foot on a AA plane again, i don't care how much more i have to pay,   \n",

Outbound flight 2.5 hours late. For the return segment we arrived at the airport 1.5 hours prior to the flight and were told we were on stand by because the flight was oversold. They did not apologize or try to accommodate us or explain the alternatives - merely told us we had to wait and it is their right to overbook. Customer service dismissed me. With a lot of drama we managed to get onboard. This is a cheap airline and you get what you pay for. There is no service onboard or on the ground. I consistently fly over 150000 miles a year and the last time I was denied boarding due to overbooking was in 1994!   \n",

I found that Air China was offering cheap ticket and transfer hotel accommodation at Beijing if your transfer time is over 7 hrs. Beijing is really cold in November at night even for adults, imagine the kids. We arrived Beijing at 00:30 for transfer and waited 1 hr in line for security check with a kid sleeping in my arms. Asked officers for priority line but none of them cared about us!! For transfer hotel you have to apply transfer visa which is an easy process i experienced before however this time the lady officer even without checking our passports carelessly and without expressing not even a little responsibility said I will not give you visa! Then i went to Air China desk, but they didnt even try a bit to help, we paid ourselves for hourly hotel to at least let baby sleep in warm. I never ever recommend Air China.   \n",

Our flight was hopping around from Toronto to Calgary to Vancouver and onwards, which explained the delay that we experienced, as the flight had just left Toronto when we arrived at our designated time at Calgary Airport (not a good sign). However, we did not know this until we heard the person ahead of us getting frustrated with the ground staff over the delay. The departures board had not been updated and still showed the original time. Furthermore, when we received our boarding passes from the ground crew, the boarding pass still showed the original time and the ground staff said nothing. We then pressed the ground staff for more answers, after which they finally replied, \"oh yeah, its delayed. Yup.\" Their complete indifference, in addition to failure to update the passengers, led to many of the customers in line losing their patience with the staff. We did not receive any updates on the estimated departure time until we were in the waiting area near the gate. On the flight itself, the seats were uncomfortable and the plane outdated. No inflight entertainment, as expected. The only thing that made all this acceptable was the very cheap price of the tickets.   \n",

              "10  Gold Coast - Kuala Lumpur return. I flew economy out and Premium return. To avoid check-in queues I recommend the online check in it took 5 minutes at the luggage drop. Economy is a fairly comfortable although legroom is tight and for tall passengers I recommend paying the extra amount for one of the \"hot seats\" (either front rows or exit rows). The check-in did offer to block off 3 economy seats for me for an extra fee (as there was space on flight) but as a day flight I did not need to sleep. I was very impressed with the meal which also comes with a bottle of water. Other onboard food purchase items reasonably priced and a fair variety. I was looking forward to my return flight in Premium class. No need to do online check-in for Premium as there is a dedicated check-in queue for maximum of 12 Premium passengers. No business lounge for Air Asia X (pay per entry Plaza Premium Lounge available). Onboard staff offered a bottle of water lots of overhead space with only 12 passengers in the premium cabin. All passengers given a blanket and cushion. After takeoff staff offered to serve meal at a time of my choice. They also offered to hold any additional food items that I may want later in the flight. The standard meal is the same as that offered in economy class. The main benefit of Premium is the almost lie flat seat. Upon arrival we were able to exit the plane first get through passport control before other passengers. I have flown Air Asia X a number of times since their launch a few years ago and will definitely aim to fly Premium again on my future Air Asia X flights.   \n",

Flight out was ok but the flight back TCX6335 was delayed for 23 hours due to a technical fault. Having sat on the tarmac for 2 hours we were sent to a shabby hotel for the night. Children on the flight back had to pay for earphones despite the horrendous delay. This is not the way to treat your customers. We will not book with Thomas Cook again. Finally got home at 2am on Monday morning when we should have been back on Saturday night.   \n",

Wizz Air is an excellent no-frills budget airline. Flights for all sectors were on time. Boarding was efficient and good to see that Wizz Air staff ensure that priority passengers are actually given priority in boarding. Cabin crew were business-like and pleasant. Announcements from the flight deck were audible and informative. Wizz Air sent useful SMS the day prior to the flight home advising of possible air-traffic delays (which did not materialise). Most of the low marks awarded to Wizz Air on Skytrax appear to be attributable to the fact that customers do not (or can not) read the terms and conditions (T&C) attaching to the tickets. Read and understand the T&C and Wizz Air provides excellent value and service.   \n",
              "13               Amsterdam to Billund. This trip was made in conjunction with the phase out of the Fokker F70 in KLM Cityhopper service. I deliberately booked this flight as a last salute to one of my favourite aircraft in which I logged almost 150 flights in the last 10 years. The outbound flight from Amsterdam to Billund was with a KLM mainline Boeing 737, nothing special, on time departure and arrival with the standard onboard service of a coffee and a snack. The return flight, in this case the very last Fokker 70 flight from Billund to Amsterdam ever started as a complete let-down at the gate, business as usual, just a bunch of absolutely unfriendly gate agents. However when boarding the aircraft everything changed totally. The aircraft cabin was decorated with little flags and once all passengers boarded, the captain entered the cabin and welcomed all passengers and explained why this flight was a special event. It was also the entire crew's last flight on the Fokker 70. Upon departure to the main runway we received a water salute from the Billund fire brigade, followed by a very powerful take-off and a low-level bye bye pass over the airport. Onboard service during the flight was standard but the cabin crew did everything to make the flight memorable, well done! Landing in Amsterdam was on the rarely used Eastern runway which is the runway used in the past by the Fokker company to test fly and deliver their aircraft to their customers. Upon disembarking all passengers were personally greeted by the captain and both cabin crew. We will miss the faithful little Fokkers!   \n",

Swiss rerouted ticket ZRH to ORD and I must say I was pleasantly surprised at how improved the Swiss Air service was (used to fly them regularly 10 years ago). The Tuscan red wine was superb and chicken cardon blue was excellent even for air travel. Staff were very friendly and helpful to both my wife and I. LX008 on 29 April.   \n",

However when boarding the aircraft everything changed totally.

It was also the entire crew's last flight on the Fokker 70. Upon departure to the main runway we received a water salute from the Billund fire brigade, followed by a very powerful take-off and a low-level bye bye pass over the airport. Onboard service during the flight was standard but the cabin crew did everything to make the flight memorable, well done! Landing in Amsterdam was on the rarely used Eastern runway which is the runway used in the past by the Fokker company to test fly and deliver their aircraft to their customers.

This trip was made in conjunction with the phase out of the Fokker F70 in KLM Cityhopper service. I deliberately booked this flight as a last salute to one of my favourite aircraft in which I logged almost 150 flights in the last 10 years. The outbound flight from Amsterdam to Billund was with a KLM mainline Boeing 737, nothing special, on time departure and arrival with the standard onboard service of a coffee and a snack. The return flight, in this case the very last Fokker 70 flight from Billund to Amsterdam ever started as a complete let-down at the gate, business as usual, just a bunch of absolutely unfriendly gate agents. However when boarding the aircraft everything changed totally. The aircraft cabin was decorated with little flags and once all passengers boarded, the captain entered the cabin and welcomed all passengers and explained why this flight was a special event. It was also the entire crew's last flight on the Fokker 70. Upon departure to the main runway we received a water salute from the Billund fire brigade, followed by a very powerful take-off and a low-level bye bye pass over the airport. Onboard service during the flight was standard but the cabin crew did everything to make the flight memorable, well done! Landing in Amsterdam was on the rarely used Eastern runway which is the runway used in the past by the Fokker company to test fly and deliver their aircraft to their customers. Upon disembarking all passengers were personally greeted by the captain and both cabin crew. We will miss the faithful little Fokkers!\",\n          \"Sacramento to Denver via Seattle. I was quite satisfied with Delta, especially during my return trip. Even though I flew the Basic Economy, they put me in decent seats. The seats were not the most comfortable, but the legroom wasn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t terrible. The onboard entertainment was wonderful with a decent variety of shows and movies. Both ground service and flight attendants were all friendly. The SEA to DEN flight did the standard drink service, but also came around two additional times: one for coffee and one for water. Overall, I was satisfied with their service and amenities. I will consider Delta for future trips.\",\n          \"CPT-LHR return. Both flights on new A330. Excellent seat comfort and lie-flat. Cabin very quiet up front even on take-off. Food very good both ways and crew attentive and friendly without being invasive. The only thing I'd mark down was the fact that no menus were loaded in London. I've flown a lot on SAA in the last 3 months and have noticed a marked improvement in food quality and variety. Passenger embarkation at LHR was clearly communicated and orderly something that should be noted by JNB ground staff. A pity the Star Alliance lounge at LHR is so tatty and uninviting.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"At the Airport\",\n          \"None related Category\",\n          \"Pre-Flight Preparation\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"reason\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The experience includes mentions of onboard service, the cabin crew's efforts to make the flight memorable, and the special event surrounding the last Fokker 70 flight.
